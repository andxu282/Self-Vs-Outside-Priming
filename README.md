# Self-Vs-Outside-Priming

This is a directed research project under the lead of Professor Martin van Schijndel and the C.Psyd Research Lab at Cornell University.
We hope to be able to better understand factors that go towards priming a code-switch as well as investigating the differences seen by an outside prime vs a self prime.
